# On-road-Obstacle-Detection
Detecting objects on road in the context of Autonomous Vehicle

The central concept of this application is to detect objects that comes in reference to the vehicle using a camera. This application can detect almost all the object that are present on road. Here, objects are detected by bounding a box around it and mentioning probability of that detection. Bounding boxes also moves as the object moves anywhere that means this application can detect objects even in motion.

As of now, this program contains two features for detection. One is live detection using any camera and another is detection through input video.
